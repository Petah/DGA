        <h1>Data Generation and Analysis (DGA)</h1>
        <p>
            DGA is a computer program designed as framework to develop algorithms.
            Its allows Java developers to implement an algorithm classes that can
            be run in parallel, produce output and then analyse and visualise the
            output produced.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project contains the core system classes. The DGA library provides
            common classes that care used in both the core system and user developed
            algorithms.
