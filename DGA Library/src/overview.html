        <h1>Data Generation and Analysis (DGA)</h1>
        <p>
            DGA is a computer program designed as framework to develop algorithms.
            Its allows Java developers to implement an algorithm classes that can
            be run in parallel, produce output and then analyse and visualise the
            output produced.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project contains the common algorithm classes used by the core system
            and user developed algrorithms.
